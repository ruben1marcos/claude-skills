<objective>
Verify milestone achieved its definition of done. Check requirements coverage, cross-phase integration, and end-to-end flows.

**This command IS the orchestrator.** Reads existing VERIFICATION.md files (phases already verified during execute-phase), aggregates tech debt and deferred gaps, then spawns integration checker for cross-phase wiring.
</objective>

<execution_context>
To load this command's workflow spec: check for `.claude/gsd-core/workflows/audit-milestone.md` relative to the current working directory first (project-local); if it is not there, fall back to `~/.claude/gsd-core/workflows/audit-milestone.md` (the global install). If neither file exists, stop — a workflow spec is required and none was found.
</execution_context>

<context>
Version: $ARGUMENTS (optional — defaults to current milestone)

Core planning files are resolved in-workflow (`init milestone-op`) and loaded only as needed.

**Completed Work:**
Glob: .planning/phases/*/*-SUMMARY.md
Glob: .planning/phases/*/*-VERIFICATION.md
</context>

<process>
Execute end-to-end.
Preserve all workflow gates (scope determination, verification reading, integration check, requirements coverage, routing).
